# README

This repository defines and implements a program to track time spent on [Linear](https://linear.app) issues.

It integrates easily into your workflow by having a very simple API and no external dependencies.

The name comes from series of [Saturday morning television commercials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_for_Timer) where the main character, Timer, reminds people what it's time for.
